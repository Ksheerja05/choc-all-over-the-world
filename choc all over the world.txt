		<h1> Chocolates All Over The World </h1>
		<p><b>Eating fine chocolate is far more than a simple indulgence. Itâ€™s a complex sensory experience.<br> The cacao tree produces cacao fruit which contains cocoa beans. 
		A chocolate produced with <br>cocoa bean grown in one region can vary completely from that produced in a region just <br>a few kilometers away. Nature gives cacao its
		flavor and these flavors ultimately become <br>a part of the chocolate.</br>
		Chocolate can vary from sweet milk chocolate to super dark chocolate<br> with 80 percent cocoa, and a lot of other options in between.<br> But, how much do you actually
		know about the different kinds of chocolate? <br>Which country produces the most chocolate? Which chocolate (sweet or bitter)<br> is more liked by people?<br>
		Here, you can find answers to a few questions like this.</p>
